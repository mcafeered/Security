penetration = ethical hacking

Testing
Exploit Development occurs from vulnerability pairing and mission-drivens requirement
Test and verify success
Testing provides a number of benefits:
Faster time to breakout of initial foothold
Reduced risk of detection and/or tool failure
Improved recovery times

Plan
Procure Hardware and software
Assign developer
Assign a tester to develop TTPs and break it
Document testing results
Testing environment

Open Source Intelligence
During the lesson we will review the following topics:
Appropriate Documentation Practices
Use of Collected Data
Collection Methods

DoD States:
"produced from publicly available information that is collected, exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience for addressing a specific intelligence requirement."
only use open source research for mission completion meeting a specific intelligence requirement

Documentation
Why is it important?
What should we include in documentation?
basically take opnotes to document what you did and how

Collection and Use
What do we want to collect?
How can it be used in operations?
We never reveal our sources and methods which indicates a NOFORN classification

Limitations on Collection
Are there rules that guide our operations and collection parameters?
What are important factors when collecting data about a target?

Data to Collect
Web Data
Sensitive Data
Publicly Accessible
Social Media
Domain and IP Data

Deep web = unlisted addresses ex. signing into your banck account

Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML)
Standardized markup language for browser interpretation of webpages

Client-side interpretation (web browser)
Utilizes elements (identified by tags)
Typically redirects to another page for server-side interaction
Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) for page themeing
can use view page source to view a website's source code, but use a website scraper for bigger/confusing websites

Advanced Scanning Techniques
HOST DISCOVERY
Find hosts that are online
HOST ENUMERATION
Find ports for each host that is online
HOST INTERROGATION
Find what service is running on each open/available port

NMAP Scripting Engine
During the lesson we will review the following topics:
Benefits of Scanning with Scripts
Script Management and Utilization
Usage and Examples

nmap can be used with several different scripts to achieve certain information

Script Management
Scripts are stored in a subdirectory of the Nmap data directory by default:
/usr/share/nmap/scripts

Usage and Examples
nmap --script <filename>|<category>|<directory>
nmap --script-help "ftp-* and discovery"
nmap --script-args <args>
nmap --script-args-file <filename>
nmap --script-help <filename>|<category>|<directory>
nmap --script-trace
